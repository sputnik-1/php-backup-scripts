php-backup-scripts

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
I wrote these PHP backup scripts in 2008 for use on my own Linux web
server at home. This was after suffering multiple hard disk failures. So
I decided enough was enough, and I wrote these scripts as part of my 
backup procedure. You will need a seperate hard drive dedicated to
backups for these scripts to work best.

I later released them on the Fedora forum under my name of CD-RW
in 2010. http://forums.fedoraforum.org/showthread.php?p=1499959

To make it easy for others to find all my work in one place, I'm moving
all my BSD-licensed code to my Github account:

https://github.com/sputnik-1/

All I ask is that you abide by the liberal BSD license, and give me the
credit for initial development of create-smart-channels.php. Any
feedback is welcome.
